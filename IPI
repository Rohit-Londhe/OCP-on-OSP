# OCP-on-OSP
**Openshift on Openstack Installation - Installer Provisioned Method**

**Versions**
Openstack 16.2
Openshift 4.11

**Openstack deployment requirements**

1. Compute node

Min 80GB RAM, 20 vcpus, 500 GB Disk

2. Controller nodes and Storage node requirements should be as per document

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/16.2/html-single/director_installation_and_usage/index#controller-node-requirements

3. Enable octavia support on openstack 

Include file "/usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/services/octavia.yaml" in your openstack deployment command.

**Creating Openstack resources for hosting OCP**

1. Create a flavor, It will be used by the OCP machines

# openstack flavor create --ram 16384 --disk 30 --vcpus 10 m1.large

2. Create a Network, Subnet and a Floating IP (FIP) address for external access to the OpenShift Container Platform API, cluster applications, and the bootstrap process.

# openstack network create --external --provider-network-type flat --provider-physical-network datacentre public

# openstack subnet create --network public --subnet-range 10.0.0.0/16 sub-public

# openstack floating ip create public

3. Creating a swift operator role

We are considering creating and using a local repository i.e undercloud. For that purpose we have decided to use the local image repo for openshift as well.

By default ocp will use default storage from openstack i.e swift which is called as the object storage

In order to use this swift object stroage we have to create a swiftoperator user account role. It is used as the default backend for the OpenShift Container Platform image registry.

# openstack role add --user admin --project admin swiftoperator

# openstack object store account set --property Temp-URL-Key=superkey

4. Openshift uses openstack resources, For that purpose we need to set quotas. (-1 stands Infinity)

# openstack quota set --secgroups -1 --secgroup-rules -1 --cores -1 --ram -1 --gigabytes -1 --subnets -1 --floating-ips -1 --networks -1 --ports -1 admin

5. We need to have a keypair which we can use for access our machines or for debug purpose while installting.

You can use this key to SSH into the master nodes as the user core. When you deploy the cluster, the key is added to the core userâ€™s ~/.ssh/authorized_keys list

# openstack keypair create --public-key .ssh/id_rsa.pub stack


**Openshift Installation - IPI**


1. The next all we need to do is download the openshift installer, CLI tools and pull secret from Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager into the 'ocp' dir.

https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install

# mkdir ocp
# tar -xf openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
# tar -xf openshift-install-linux.tar.gz
# mkdir try1 

2. Creating install-config file

# ./openshift-install create install-config --dir=try1

Take a backup of the install-config file and edit as per your requiements. Make sure you add proper domain name and DNS, Also make sure that Network IP's are of different range

3. If you do not control the DNS server, you can access the cluster by adding the cluster domain names such as the following to your /etc/hosts file

~~~
10.0.0.12 api.ocp.dev.lab   // floating api ip
~~~

4. Creating Cluster

# ./openshift-install create cluster --dir=try1 --log-level=debug

It takes ~30 mins for the cluster installation. Once the cluster is successfully installed you can export the kubconfig file in order to execute use 'oc' commands

$ export KUBECONFIG=<installation_directory>/auth/kubeconfig

5. Verify cluster installation

$ oc get nodes
$ oc get clusterversion
$ oc get clusteroperator
$ oc get pods -A
